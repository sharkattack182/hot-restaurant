# Hot Restaurant

## Purpose
This was an end of the chapter project for in which I used express to create a server side app that allows a user to view the tables available at a restaurant as well as being able to view the waitlist. The user can also reserve a table tvy filling at and submitting a form. The reservation is then saved to theserver and rendered in the waitlist.  

## Process
This project was really fun. I had to set up all the html pages to fit an example given in the assignment. Once the pages were styled I moved on to creaing my server.js file. In that file i set up a basic server with express.js and defined all the routes needed. I created some basic seeder information then used get calls to render the information on the page. Then I set up a post route to add a reservation. The project was really a confidence booster in using express and understanding the routes. This part of the bootcamp was where I really felt I didnt understand the material. I think the chapter was very quick and I am glad I took the time rto relearn the material.
